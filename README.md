# Taxi Fare Prediction
This end to end course project is part of Google Advanced Data Analytics course on coursera.

## Project goal:
In this fictional scenario, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) has approached the data consulting firm Automatidata to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride.

## Background:
Since 1971, TLC has been regulating and overseeing the licensing of New York City's taxi cabs, for-hire vehicles, commuter vans, and paratransit vehicles.

## Scenario:
You are a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidataâ€™s focus is to help clients transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions. In this scenario, you will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride.

This project is done in several steps:

### Step 1: Inspect and analyze data
In this step, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Understand the situation
* Prepare to understand and organize the provided taxi cab dataset ([2017 Yellow TaxiTrip Data](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2017-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/biws-g3hs)) and information.

#### Part 2: Understand the data
* Create a pandas dataframe for data learning, future exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical activities.
* Compile summary information about the data to inform next steps.

#### Part 3: Understand the variables
* Use insights from your examination of the summary data to guide deeper investigation into specific variables.

### Step 2: Exploratory data analysis
In this step, you will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. You will also design a professional data visualization that tells a story, and will help data-driven decisions for business needs.

This step has 4 parts:

#### Part 1: Imports, links, and loading

####  Part 2: Data Exploration
* Data cleaning

#### Part 3: Building visualizations

#### Part 4: Evaluate and share results

### Step 3: Statistical analysis
In this step, you will practice using statistics to analyze and interpret data.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Imports and data loading
* What data packages will be necessary for hypothesis testing?

#### Part 2: Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing
* How did computing descriptive statistics help you analyze your data?
* How did you formulate your null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis?

#### Part 3: Communicate insights with stakeholders
* What key business insight(s) emerged from your A/B test?
* What business recommendations do you propose based on your results?

### Step 4: Build a multiple linear regression model
In this step, you will build a multiple linear regression model. Multiple linear regression helps you estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: EDA & Checking Model Assumptions
* What are some purposes of EDA before constructing a multiple linear regression model?

#### Part 2: Model Building and evaluation
* What resources do you find yourself using as you complete this stage?

#### Part 3: Interpreting Model Results
* What key insights emerged from your model(s)?
* What business recommendations do you propose based on the models built?

### Step 5: Build a machine learning model
In this step, you will practice using tree-based modeling techniques to predict on a binary target class.

This step has 3 parts:

#### Part 1: Ethical considerations
* Consider the ethical implications of the request
* Should the objective of the model be adjusted?

#### Part 2: Feature engineering
* Perform feature selection, extraction, and transformation to prepare the data for modeling

#### Part 3: Modeling
* Build the models, evaluate them, and advise on next steps
